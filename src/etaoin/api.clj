  "A wrapper over the [W3C WebDriver Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/) to automate popular browsers.

  Tries to normalize differences across the various implementations.

(defn execute
  "Return response from having `:driver` execute HTTP `:method` request to `:path` with body `:data`.

  Response body automatically converted from JSON to a clojure keywordized map.
  Any HTTP status failure code results in a throw.

  - `:method` HTTP method, e.g. `:get`, `:post`, `:delete`, etc.
  - `:path` a vector of strings/keywords representing a server's path. For example:
      - this: `[:session \"aaaa-bbbb-cccc\" :element \"dddd-eeee\" :find]`
      - becomes: `\"/session/aaaa-bbbb-cccc/element/dddd-eeee/find\"`.
  - `:data` optional body to send. Automatically converted to JSON.

  implementation specific feature that Etaoin has not otherwise exposed.

     - (use `{:id \"my-id\"}` for ids that cannot be represented as keywords)
   - an XPath expression:

   - a map with either `:xpath` or `:css`:

     - `{:css \"input#uname[name='username']\"}`
   - any other map is converted to an XPath expression:
     - `{:tag :div}`
     - is equivalent to XPath: `\".//div\"`
   - multiple of the above (wrapped in a vector or not).

  Don't forget to add `return <something>` operator if you are

  The driver passes a special handler as the last argument that should be called

  *Note:* calling this function requires the `script` timeout to be set properly,

  - `args`: additional arguments for your code. Automatically converted to JSON.

  Example of a script:
