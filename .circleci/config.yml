      # For better visibility in the build summary page, we use a separate
      # run step per test file. In this case, we don't want to stop the build
      # on first failure, so we use the `when` keyword.

      # Note on the ETAOIN_TEST_DRIVERS environment variable:
      # The only reason we override the logic to select the drivers is due to
      # the following bug:
      # When using firefox, at a certain point there is an exception thrown
      # from the fixture code. clojure.test is not able to withstand this
      # and just chokes. As such, we split the tests between firefox-only
      # and everything but firefox to allow to compare them (and see that
      # the firefox tests report "ran 0 tests" due to the fixture bug)

# TODO
#
# * Emit test results in XUNIT format so that CircleCI can provide useful
#   statistics, see
#   https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#store_test_results
#
# * (optimization) parallelize the test jobs with CircleCI `workflows`
