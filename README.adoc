A pure Clojure implementation of the link:{url-webdriver}[Webdriver] protocol, named after link:{url-short-story}[Etaoin Shrdlu] -- a typing machine that came to life after a mysterious note was produced on it.

Use the Etaoin library to automate a browser, test your frontend behaviour, simulate human actions or whatever you want.

== Benefits

* Selenium-free: no big dependencies, no tons of downloaded jars, etc.
* Lightweight, fast.
Simple, easy to understand.
* Compact: just one main namespace with a couple of helpers.
* Declarative: the code is just a list of actions.

== Capabilities

* Currently supports Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge.
* Can either connect to a remote WebDriver process, or have Etaoin launch one for you.
* Run your unit tests directly from Emacs by pressing `C-t t` as usual.
* Can imitate human-like behaviour (delays, typos, etc).

== Documentation

API docs and articles are best viewed on link:{url-doc}[cljdoc]:

== Versioning

Eatoin uses: `major`.`minor`.`patch`-`test-qualifier`

* `major` increments when a non alpha release API has been broken - something, as a rule, we'd like to avoid.
* `minor` increments to convey significant new features have been added.
* `patch` indicates bug fixes or minor changes - it is the total number of releases to date.
* `test-qualifier` is absent for stable releases.
Can be `alpha`, `beta`, `rc1`, etc.
